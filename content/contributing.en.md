In this page you will find all the information needed to contribute to the project.
First of all, it is needed to define some form of CoC to better express our stance regarding interpersonal relationships.

# Code of Conduct


When contributing with/on this platform or related ones, e.g. the GitHub repositories related to Suzunaan,
you accept the terms and conditions outlined in this document.

You **shall**:

 1. **Respect others.**

    Use friendly and welcoming language, also respect others' pronouns and viewpoints.

    If a constructive and productive discussion is impossible (e.g. because of extremely different viewpoints and
    worldviews), then it is better for everyone to not engage in a discussion at all.

 2. **Focus on the interests of the community.**

You **shall _not_**:

 1. **Engage in inflammatory behaviour.**

    This community shall be founded on respect for each other, including other neutral or alike projects.

    Do not belittle, insult, troll and/or engage in discussions with other people, groups, organizations, members,
    projects and so on.


 2. **Discriminate against marginalized groups.**

    By "marginalized" we typically mean women, LGBT+ folks, PoC, disabled folks and similar groups;
    by "discriminate" we thus mean episodes of sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, biphobia, ableism and so on.

    The above definitions inherently can not be all-encompassing, so the interpretation and application of this rule
    is at the discretion of the admins.

 3. **Publish others' personal information (doxing).**

    Including physical and/or digital addresses and other informations without their consent.

 4. **Act inappropriately.**

    While we do not like "corporateness" and we pretty much like fun and sillyness, we will not tolerate childish
    behaviour.

Failure to respect the above rules will result in your current and future contributions to be rejected and, possibly, be
banned from the community.

# Philosophy

Additionally, please **remember that**:

 1. **This community is pretty much left/anarchist-adjacent.**

    While we do not *really* care about your politics, software is not inherently apolitical and some choices will
    inevitably reflect this.
    We *do not* have any problems with contributions coming from various points of the political spectrum,
    *provided you respect the rules above*.

 2. **We do not want software to be subject to ["enshittification"](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys).**

    Software should only be open-source, possibly conflicting with commercial usages to discourage cloud re-selling
    (e.g. how AWS did with Elasticsearch).
    [AGPL3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-affero-gpl.html) is a suitable license for this purpose.

    Software should work for the user, not the contrary.

 3. **We do not accept venture capital or investments.**

    Money is, for all intents and purposes, the root of all evil, especially VC money.
    VCs do not care about stable returns but *big* returns in investments, leading to the aforementioned
    ["enshittification"](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys) process.

    As a result, since we care about users we will not make use of predatory business practices:
    each and every project *must* start and remain indie for all its lifetime.

    If money is needed, then it must come from donations and/or crowdfunding.

If the political stance of this community makes you uncomfortable, it is perfectly fine for all
parties involved to not interact with eachother and save everyone's time.

On the contrary, if you think that these ideas are more in line with your personal philosophy, then great, welcome aboard!

# How to contribute

If you want to contribute with code or assets, then you should head to the [Github organization](https://github.com/BellHermitage)
where you will find all the repositories related to the project.
We are in the process of opening a Gitea instance at [git.suzunaan.org](https://git.suzunaan.org), where other
projects will take place.
At this point in time, such subdomain does not exist.
