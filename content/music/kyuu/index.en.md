During the New Year's Eve of 2019, an indie Japanese music group ("circle") known as 凋叶棕 (_diao ye zong_, "withered leaf") released an album simply titled "彁" at the 97th edition of Comic Market, and it kind of explored how we think about stories and creativity.

I'm sure that most people reading that first line are puzzled as to what all of those words mean, since you may not be familiar with doujinshi culture. To put it simply, Japan has a large enough indie scene of various kind, from mangas to music and even to fan-made animes, which is organized under the umbrella term of "doujinshi" (kinda meaning "indie").
Typically such endeavors are released in "events" (like, fairs) that happen multiple times during the year.
The Comic Market (or simply Comiket) is the largest event and it takes place at the Tokyo Big Sight.
In this case we are interested in doujin music (同人音楽, _doujin ongaku_) and, to be more specific, in an album based on music from Touhou Project.

Touhou is a series of doujin games, music CDs, mangas and even light novels about the life in a sealed world living beside our own called Gensokyo ("Fantasy Land"), where witches, gods and all kinds of folklore exist: basically Gensokyo is a fork of 19th century Japan in which modern technology is not prevalent and spiritualism is at its peak. Generally speaking, the plot of the games is about some youkais ("monsters") ruining stuff in Gensokyo and the heroine (you) has to battle them to fix everything.

With this innocent premise, you may be wondering: why care about an album about some games about saving the world?
Well, it really goes in depth about our relationship with stories --- really _a lot_ in depth --- but before going over the album I have to make a really important point: to understand 彁 you need to know some cursory stuff about Touhou and Gensokyo, but to give a complete enough introduction to Touhou here will further complicate this blog post.
If you played the games and have a general understanding of the story and the characters, then you're set! If not, I suggest you read [this blog post](https://magic.witchgirls.moe/2019/06/gay-girls-whom-danmaku.html) to understand more in depth what Touhou is about and its themes.
I'll still be explaining the album and its meaning as we go over it --- but I'll assume that you know basic stuff about the serie.

So, before going over the album, I _have_ to talk about the group that made it, at least a little bit.

# Who is 凋叶棕?

凋叶棕 (_Diao ye Zong_, "withered leaf"; just DyZ from now on) is a doujin music group that makes music about Touhou using music from the games. There are three important members of this group: RD-Sounds, Merami and nayuta. RD is the person in charge of everything _but_ singing: they arrange, compose, come up with lyrics and so on, while Merami and nayuta are the singers. Some other singers appear as guests and others join for guest arranges and general help, but at their the core DyZ has just those three members.

The group is focused on analyzing the characters and stories in Touhou, create new stories about them with the goal of making the listener think about a topic. The title of each album is a single kanji (character) which _is_ the topic that the group wants to explore.
In its songs RD loves to include obscure references to other works, censor some words and play around with the booklet (the paper book that comes with the CDs), all to let the listener engage more with the story that they want to tell.

With just the bare minimum of the introductions to go by, we can finally take a look at the album.

# First impressions

The very first thing you come across is the title of the album: simply "彁". As I said before, the names of the albums from DyZ are just a single kanji that set the topic for the various songs --- well, the kanji "彁" doesn't exist, so it can't have a meaning. Nice party trick huh?

"Oh come on" --- you wonder --- "I'm literally seeing it on the screen, if the kanji doesn't exist how can it be right before my eyes?"

It doesn't exist, really. In the 20th century the Japanese Industrial Standards was in development to allow the digital representation of kanjis in computers --- unfortunately some kanjis that do not exist were erroneously added to the 1976 standard. Nowadays such kanjis are called 幽霊文字 (_yuurei moji_, "ghost kanjis"), you can read more about them [here](https://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/yuureimoji.html). So not even one second in the album and just the title has three paragraphs worth of explanation. That's fun.

After looking at the title, the very next thing you come across is the cover art:

![Cover art](https://en.touhouwiki.net/images/6/6f/RDWL-0030.jpg)

In the image there is depicted [Reimu](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Reimu_Hakurei) sleeping while holding an yin-yang orb, with a stylized version of Gensokyo in the background with the title in red superimposed on everything else.
The cover art has mostly red highlights with white-ish parts, which is a play on Reimu's color palette (the "red and white miko").
Such image carries a lot of symbolism, as we shall see later on, so keep it in mind.
