title: "彁 is genius and here's why"

During the New Year's Eve of 2019, an indie Japanese music group ("circle") known as 凋叶棕 (_diao ye zong_, "withered leaf") released an album simply titled "彁" at the 97th edition of Comic Market, and it kind of explored how we think about stories and creativity.

I'm sure that most people reading that first line are puzzled as to what all of those words mean, since you may not be familiar with doujinshi culture. To put it simply, Japan has a large enough indie scene of various kind, from mangas to music and even to fan-made animes, which is organized under the umbrella term of "doujinshi" (kinda meaning "indie").
Typically such endeavors are released in "events" (like, fairs) that happen multiple times during the year.
The Comic Market (or simply Comiket) is the largest event and it takes place at the Tokyo Big Sight.
In this case we are interested in doujin music (同人音楽, _doujin ongaku_) and, to be more specific, in an album based on music from Touhou Project.

Touhou is a series of doujin games, music CDs, mangas and even light novels about the life in a sealed world living beside our own called Gensokyo ("Fantasy Land"), where witches, gods and all kinds of folklore exist: basically Gensokyo is a fork of 19th century Japan in which modern technology is not prevalent and spiritualism is at its peak. Generally speaking, the plot of the games is about some youkais ("monsters") ruining stuff in Gensokyo and the heroine (you) has to battle them to fix everything.

With this innocent premise, you may be wondering: why care about an album about some games about saving the world?
Well, it really goes in depth about our relationship with stories --- really _a lot_ in depth --- but before going over the album I have to make a really important point: to understand 彁 you need to know some cursory stuff about Touhou and Gensokyo, but to give a complete enough introduction to Touhou here will further complicate this blog post.
If you played the games and have a general understanding of the story and the characters, then you're set! If not, I suggest you read [this blog post](https://magic.witchgirls.moe/2019/06/gay-girls-whom-danmaku.html) to understand more in depth what Touhou is about and its themes.
I'll still be explaining the album and its meaning as we go over it --- but I'll assume that you know basic stuff about the serie.

So, before going over the album, I _have_ to talk about the group that made it, at least a little bit.

# Who is 凋叶棕?

凋叶棕 (_Diao ye Zong_, "withered leaf"; just DyZ from now on) is a doujin music group that makes music about Touhou using music from the games. There are three important members of this group: RD-Sounds, Merami and nayuta. RD is the person in charge of everything _but_ singing: they arrange, compose, come up with lyrics and so on, while Merami and nayuta are the singers. Some other singers appear as guests and others join for guest arranges and general help, but at their the core DyZ has just those three members.

The group is focused on analyzing the characters and stories in Touhou, create new stories about them with the goal of making the listener think about a topic. The title of each album is a single kanji (character) which _is_ the topic that the group wants to explore.
In its songs RD loves to include obscure references to other works, censor some words and play around with the booklet (the paper book that comes with the CDs), all to let the listener engage more with the story that they want to tell.

With just the bare minimum of the introductions to go by, we can finally take a look at the album.

# First impressions

The very first thing you come across is the title of the album: simply "彁". As I said before, the names of the albums from DyZ are just a single kanji that set the topic for the various songs --- well, the kanji "彁" doesn't exist, so it can't have a meaning. Nice party trick huh?

In the 20th century the Japanese Industrial Standards was in development to allow the digital representation of kanjis in computers --- unfortunately some kanjis that do not exist were erroneously added to the 1976 standard. Nowadays such kanjis are called 幽霊文字 (_yuurei moji_, "ghost kanjis"), you can read more about them [here](https://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/yuureimoji.html). So not even one second in the album and just the title has three paragraphs worth of explanation. That's fun.

After looking at the title, the very next thing you come across is the cover art:

![Cover art](https://en.touhouwiki.net/images/6/6f/RDWL-0030.jpg)

In the image there is depicted [Reimu](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Reimu_Hakurei) sleeping while holding an yin-yang orb, with a stylized version of Gensokyo in the background with the title in red superimposed on everything else.
The cover art has mostly red highlights with white-ish parts, which is a play on Reimu's color palette (the "red and white miko").
Such image carries a lot of symbolism, as we shall see later on, so keep it in mind.

After the cover art, you open the jewel case and take a look at the CD:

At first you notice just the transparent title over the bold red Gensokyo, but looking around the sides there's some text! This is something RD does a lot: almost every album has a "CD text" which includes a standard prelude and then something about it. This in particular reads:

> This CD is symbolically made from Curtain Fire Shooting game.
> You don't have to wait until it is ready.
> Because contents have already been prepared.
>
> Question:
> Why can't we stop imagining about her?
> We may have no correct answer.
> Or it's just because she is beautiful.

The first line is always the same in every album and it lets you know that this album is based on characters from Touhou. The second line is the most interesting because it talks about someone that we can't stop imagining about. That "her" that is "so beautiful" is Reimu, as a nod to her title as "Wonderful Shrine Maiden of Paradise".

Why can't we stop imagining about her? It's not just about her title, but to figure this one out we have to come back to it after listening to the songs.

# The songs

About the songs, most of them have vocals --- while some do not --- and the ones that do have an illustration in the booklet; this is typical for RD: after listening to the songs it's almost a requirement to go and look at the artworks to figure out the meaning. Not that the lyrics don't stand by themselves, but RD tries to make some concepts more obvious in the illustrations, if possible.

There is not _really_ that much to say about the instrumental songs, but for the sake of completeness I'll still go over them, albeit briefly.

Now, let's go.

## ALL EVIL MISCHIEF

The first instrumental song of the album. It's a mash-up of the Player's Score screen from Mountain of Faith and Necrofantasia from Perfect Cherry Blossom. After about 2 minutes of anticipation and crescendos with an almost evil/wicked vibe, the song develops in full with a more melancholy feel, as if what we are witnessing is the "end" of "something" important.
It then finally dies of peacefully.

Looking ahead, and considering that one of the themes here is Necrofantasia, I feel like this is an introduction to the main topic of the album: the deconstruction of Gensokyo.

## ホーカス・ポーカス

_Hocus Pocus_ is the second song of the album, with vocals from Merami. It stars [Marisa Kirisame](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Marisa_Kirisame), an ordinary magician and long-time friend of Reimu.
If taken literally, the song is about Marisa burning alive a group of catholics as retribution for the witch-hunts of 15th to 18th century Europe; but there are other possible interpretations so we'll still go over it.

First of all "Hocus Pocus" is a (non-sense) magic formula which can mean two things: either nothing, as in "something meaningless", or a deception of sorts to hide something from another person. This will come in handy later on when those words are referenced.

The song starts with a catholic whispering the following:

| Original | Romaji | English |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 信じる者はすくわれる    | shinjiru mono wa sukuwareru |Believers shall be saved                          |
| 足から全部すくわれる    | ashi kara zenbu sukuwareru  |From the soles of their feet to tip of their heads|
| わかっていながらもーー  | wakatte inagara mo          |While I knew that, still-- |

The first two lines are in reference to Deuteronomy 28:35 which, regarding what happens to Israeliti people for _disobeying_ God, states:

> The Lord will give you sore boils on your knees and legs that cannot be cured, and they will go from the soles of your feet to the tops of your heads.

In the case of the lyrics the meaning is reversed! The one speaking is apparently either about to do something bad --- for which they figured that what they are doing is morally questionable --- or they are a victim.
If we assume the theory that the song is _really_ about Marisa burning them alive then we're in the latter case.

From now on Marisa will speak until the end of the song.

| Original | Romaji | English |
|----------|--------|---------|
|お前は弱くも脆弱で| omae wa yowaku mo zeijaku de | You are weak and fragile |
|どうせ誰にも勝てはしない | douse dare ni mo kate wa shinai | There's no way you could win against anyone |
|生まれ育ちは　変えられぬままに |umaresodachi wa kaerarenu mama ni |You were born and raised like that, and you never changed |
|身の程知るがいいが |minohodo shiru ga ii ga |                      So you better not forget who you are |
|しかるにお前は賢くって|    shikaru ni omae wa kashikoku tte | On the other hand, you are rather smart|
|そればかりは誰にも負けない|sore bakari wa dare ni mo makenai |No one's gonna beat you on that plane|
|たった一つの　その武器を持てば | tatta hitotsu no sono buki wo moteba | You only need that one weapon|
|怖いものなく |                   kowai mono naku |                      And you should fear no one|
|たとえこの世界が |tatoe kono sekai ga |So even when the world|
|牙を剥き出しにしても |kiba wo mukidashi ni shite mo |Bares its fangs at you |
|そのすべて撃せばいい |sono subete taoseba ii |You should have no problem defeating them|
|「方法」はもう知ったから |yarikato wa mou shitta kara |After all, you know the right way to do it!|

Marisa describes two groups of people: those who lack (for simplicity) "intelligence" and those who do not.
The ones that are not smart enough to see the trickery will perish if they do not escape their condition, for which she thinks it's not possible to recover. While the other group is smart enough to defend themselves from and outsmart whatever lies ahead of them.
It may be tempting to assume that what she's really categorizing is who believes in God and who doesn't, but unfortunately it's wrong and it will be clear why shortly.

Also, notice how the voice of the singer changes as she talks about the two groups: for the first one you can feel _pity_ mixed with _disgust_, for the second one she is more _proud_ and happy about them. When she talks about ways to live on she becomes more wicked.

| Original | Romaji | English |
|----------|--------|---------|
|傾け　もっと　もっと重く |katamuke motto motto omoku |Now bend, as the weight gets bigger|
|あるもの皆　乗せ切るまで |aru mono mina nosekiru made |Until you pull through everything|
|そしたら全部　くべるんだ |soshitara zenbu kuberu nda |Afterwards, throw them all in the fire|
|ひとさじの未練ごと |hito saji no miren-goto |Add a spoonful of regret!|

Marisa proposes a challenge to both of the previous groups and, as they overcome whatever she created, they have to regretfully abandon "something" by burning it (which may or may not be symbolical in meaning).
While it is not specified we can assume that whatever this challenge is, it can be reasonably overcame only by the second group but at a great personal cost.

After this, we finally get to one revelation:

| Original | Romaji | English |
|----------|--------|---------|
|ホーカス・ポーカス |hookasu pookasu |Hocus Pocus|
|この魔法に種も仕掛けもないのだと |kono mahou ni tane mo shikake mo nai no da to |There's no trick to this magic|
|信じるも信じぬも愚か |shinjiru mo shinjinu mo oroka |You're a fool whether you believe in it or not|
|さあどうだざまあみろ |saa dou da zamaa miro |Now tell me how you like it!|

First of all, Marisa makes fun of the challengers by saying that whatever they endured was actually just hocus pocus --- **an illusion** of sorts. Whatever she did it probably was made with magic, after all "there's no trick to this magic" --- or is it really?

The third verse really sets it apart: you're a fool if you think such magic is real or fake. This means that the "intelligence" she spoke of earlier is _not_ about distinguishing who believes or not in magic, because you're a fool if you take _any_ of the two choice excluding the other. This is fitting to the first group she spoke of earlier.

So "intelligence" is a more quirky concept: to overcome her challenge you have to believe _and_ not believe in magic at the same time. A way to reason about this idea is by just remaining skeptic but accept that you might be tricked: magic exists, _but what if it doesn't_? If magic doesn't really exist, you just witnessed **an illusion**. If magic exists, you are a fool for not getting it.

What did Marisa do?


You can observe that the lyrics for this song are total hocus pocus: either they are meaningless or they _pretend to be meaningless_. (I hope you see where this is going.)
