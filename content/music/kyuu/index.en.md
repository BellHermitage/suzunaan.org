title: "彁 is genius and here's why"

During the New Year's Eve of 2019, an indie Japanese music group ("circle") known as 凋叶棕 (_diao ye zong_, "withered leaf") released an album simply titled "彁" at the 97th edition of Comic Market, and it kind of explored how we think about stories and creativity.

I'm sure that most people reading that first line are puzzled as to what all of those words mean, since you may not be familiar with doujinshi culture. To put it simply, Japan has a large enough indie scene of various kind, from mangas to music and even to fan-made animes, which is organized under the umbrella term of "doujinshi" (kinda meaning "indie").
Typically such endeavors are released in "events" (like, fairs) that happen multiple times during the year.
The Comic Market (or simply Comiket) is the largest event and it takes place at the Tokyo Big Sight.
In this case we are interested in doujin music (同人音楽, _doujin ongaku_) and, to be more specific, in an album based on music from Touhou Project.

Touhou is a series of doujin games, music CDs, mangas and even light novels about the life in a sealed world living beside our own called Gensokyo ("Fantasy Land"), where witches, gods and all kinds of folklore exist: basically Gensokyo is a fork of 19th century Japan in which modern technology is not prevalent and spiritualism is at its peak. Generally speaking, the plot of the games is about some youkais ("monsters") ruining stuff in Gensokyo and the heroine (you) has to battle them to fix everything.

With this innocent premise, you may be wondering: why care about an album about some games about saving the world?
Well, it really goes in depth about our relationship with stories --- really _a lot_ in depth --- but before going over the album I have to make a really important point: to understand 彁 you need to know some cursory stuff about Touhou and Gensokyo, but to give a complete enough introduction to Touhou here will further complicate this blog post.
If you played the games and have a general understanding of the story and the characters, then you're set! If not, I suggest you read [this blog post](https://magic.witchgirls.moe/2019/06/gay-girls-whom-danmaku.html) to understand more in depth what Touhou is about and its themes.
I'll still be explaining the album and its meaning as we go over it --- but I'll assume that you know basic stuff about the serie.

So, before going over the album, I _have_ to talk about the group that made it, at least a little bit.

## Who is 凋叶棕?

凋叶棕 (_Diao ye Zong_, "withered leaf"; just DyZ from now on) is a doujin music group that makes music about Touhou using music from the games. There are three important members of this group: RD-Sounds, Merami and nayuta. RD is the person in charge of everything _but_ singing: they arrange, compose, come up with lyrics and so on, while Merami and nayuta are the singers. Some other singers appear as guests and others join for guest arranges and general help, but at their the core DyZ has just those three members.

The group is focused on analyzing the characters and stories in Touhou, create new stories about them with the goal of making the listener think about a topic. The title of each album is a single kanji (character) which _is_ the topic that the group wants to explore.
In its songs RD loves to include obscure references to other works, censor some words and play around with the booklet (the paper book that comes with the CDs), all to let the listener engage more with the story that they want to tell.

With just the bare minimum of the introductions to go by, we can finally take a look at the album.

## First impressions

The very first thing you come across is the title of the album: simply "彁". As I said before, the names of the albums from DyZ are just a single kanji that set the topic for the various songs --- well, the kanji "彁" doesn't exist, so it can't have a meaning. Nice party trick huh?

In the 20th century the Japanese Industrial Standards was in development to allow the digital representation of kanjis in computers --- unfortunately some kanjis that do not exist were erroneously added to the 1976 standard. Nowadays such kanjis are called 幽霊文字 (_yuurei moji_, "ghost kanjis"), you can read more about them [here](https://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/yuureimoji.html). So not even one second in the album and just the title has three paragraphs worth of explanation. That's fun.

After looking at the title, the very next thing you come across is the cover art:

{{< figure src="images/cover_art.jpg" alt="The cover art for the album" >}}

In the image there is depicted [Reimu](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Reimu_Hakurei) sleeping while holding an yin-yang orb, with a stylized version of Gensokyo in the background with the title in red superimposed on everything else.
The cover art has mostly red highlights with white-ish parts, which is a play on Reimu's color palette (the "red and white miko").
Such image carries a lot of symbolism, as we shall see later on, so keep it in mind.

After the cover art, you open the jewel case and take a look at the CD:

{{< figure src="images/cd.png" alt="A scan of the CD" >}}

At first you notice just the transparent title over the bold red Gensokyo, but looking around the sides there's some text! This is something RD does a lot: almost every album has a "CD text" which includes a standard prelude and then something about it. This in particular reads:

> This CD is symbolically made from Curtain Fire Shooting game.
> You don't have to wait until it is ready.
> Because contents have already been prepared.
>
> Question:
> Why can't we stop imagining about her?
> We may have no correct answer.
> Or it's just because she is beautiful.

The first line is always the same in every album and it lets you know that this album is based on characters from Touhou. The second line is the most interesting because it talks about someone that we can't stop imagining about. That "her" that is "so beautiful" is Reimu, as a nod to her title as "Wonderful Shrine Maiden of Paradise".

Why can't we stop imagining about her? It's not just about her title, but to figure this one out we have to come back to it after listening to the songs.

## The songs

About the songs, most of them have vocals --- while some do not --- and the ones that do have an illustration in the booklet; this is typical for RD: after listening to the songs it's almost a requirement to go and look at the artworks to figure out the meaning. Not that the lyrics don't stand by themselves, but RD tries to make some concepts more obvious in the illustrations, if possible.

There is not _really_ that much to say about the instrumental songs, but for the sake of completeness I'll still go over them, albeit briefly.

Now, let's go.

### ALL EVIL MISCHIEF

The first instrumental song of the album. It's a mash-up of the Player's Score screen from Mountain of Faith and Necrofantasia from Perfect Cherry Blossom. After about 2 minutes of anticipation and crescendos with an almost evil/wicked vibe, the song develops in full with a more melancholy feel, as if what we are witnessing is the "end" of "something" important.
It then finally dies of peacefully.

Looking ahead, and considering that one of the themes here is Necrofantasia, I feel like this is an introduction to the main topic of the album: the deconstruction of Gensokyo.

### ホーカス・ポーカス

_Hocus Pocus_ is the second song of the album, with vocals from Merami. It stars [Marisa Kirisame](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Marisa_Kirisame), an ordinary magician and long-time friend of Reimu.
If taken literally, the song is about Marisa burning alive a group of catholics as retribution for the witch-hunts of 15th to 18th century Europe; but there are other possible interpretations so we'll still go over it.

First of all "Hocus Pocus" is a (non-sense) magic formula which can mean two things: either nothing, as in "something meaningless", or a deception of sorts to hide something from another person. This will come in handy later on when those words are referenced.

The translations for this song are taken from [Izydore/Nazohato](https://nazohato.wordpress.com/2020/01/03/%E3%83%9B%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AB%E3%82%B9%E3%83%BB%E3%83%9D%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AB%E3%82%B9-%E5%87%8B%E5%8F%B6%E6%A3%95/) and [kafka-fuura](https://kafkafuura.wordpress.com/2020/01/04/hocus-pocus/).

The song starts with someone whispering the following:

| 信じる者はすくわれる    | shinjiru mono wa sukuwareru |Believers shall be saved                          |
| 足から全部すくわれる    | ashi kara zenbu sukuwareru  |From the soles of their feet to tip of their heads|
| わかっていながらもーー  | wakatte inagara mo          |While I knew that, still-- |
{{</ details >}}

The first two lines are in reference to Deuteronomy 28:35 which, regarding what happens to Israeliti people for _disobeying_ God, states:

> The Lord will give you sore boils on your knees and legs that cannot be cured, and they will go from the soles of your feet to the tops of your heads.

In the case of the lyrics the meaning is reversed! The one speaking is apparently either about to do something bad --- for which they figured that what they are doing is morally questionable --- or they are a victim.

From now on Marisa will speak until the end of the song.

{{</ details >}}

Here Marisa is speaking in second-person to one or more people.
She describes someone which is both really weak and extremely smart/clever at the same time: so smart that even if the circumstances are dire they can turn around whatever challenge they are facing.
Notice how the voice of the singer changes as she talks about the traits: for being weak you can feel _pity_ mixed with _disgust_, for being clever she is more _proud_ and happy. When talking about ways to live on she becomes more wicked.

<!-- Another way of interpreting it is that, really, there are _two_ groups of people that she's describing. -->
<!-- This however doesn't make sense. -->

{{</ details >}}

Whoever she's referring to has to go on with a great _sacrifice_ to make ends meet, knowing full well that in the end it's useless.
This can be connected to the first stanza: we can safely assume that there's a "ritual" of sorts going on which will result in the one doing it to be "saved" in some way --- but they know something isn't right: they are hurting people and it isn't working.

Another way of interpreting it is that maybe they must overcome a major challenge which comes at a great cost.

{{</ details >}}

Those last two stanzas kinda point out that the second-person verses may be self-referential and what we're really observing is Marisa herself, maybe carrying out a great "magic" she's unsure about.

In the first verse Marisa makes fun of herself by noting that all of this is just hocus pocus --- **an illusion** of sorts.
We then cannot conclude that what she did it was made with magic: we are fools for thinking that what she's doing is "real magic" or if that it's an illusion. What is really happening then? Well we can't know, because to know what's happening we need to look beyond the illusion but we don't know if we're being tricked anyway! So, what gives? We have to pretend that what we're reading is both true and false at the same time: magic exists, but something isn't right.

Still she tries anyway, because she's sure to win in the end.
Whoever she's struggling with is getting tricked by Marisa, and in the end will figure everything out.

{{</ details >}}

Again she goes on about describing herself: she may be alone but her intellect and her insane resolve are strong enough to try the impossible.

{{</ details >}}

Marisa is trying to convince her enemies ~~(and herself)~~ that this magic is all real; after all, it's "normal" that it doesn't initially work: it can't be balanced out.
Obviously, this is a made up excuse.

Also, one of the words written in the booklet is not sung! In "ひとすじの**火種**として", 火種 is "hidame", which means "live coal". Instead "koi" is sung, which means love or romance.

{{</ details >}}

People are figuring out her tricks, but she doesn't care: she will bluff and continue to do so until everyone is convinced that they're witnessing real magic.
Through the sheer power of lies she will finally transcend what is possible for a mere human and beat everyone, while maintaining this illusion.

{{</ details >}}

And, finally, she's revealing her tricks.

You can observe that the lyrics for this song are total hocus pocus: either they are meaningless or they _pretend to be meaningless_.
What does it all mean anyway?


Thinking about the song as simply "Marisa burning some catholics alive" is kinda reductive, isn't it?
To be fair, there's the theme of religion going on that may hint at this theory, especially the quote on Deuteronomy, but alas we can't really tell what is happening or the exact reason for such sacrifices.
Really, a more interesting interpretation is that what we are witnessing is just Marisa trying to solve an incident and dueling the various bosses and fairies _without_ using magic. In fact, she may be making everything up, bullshitting her way until the incident is solved.

What if Marisa _wasn't_ a witch?

#### The illusion of magic

Compared to other characters Marisa is kinda weak: to give some perspective the heroine Reimu can just ["float out of existence"](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Reimu_Hakurei#Abilities) to win a battle. But still, Marisa's the other main heroine, she must win the battles! But how? RD poses that what she lacks in mere strength is compensated with brain power: well, she _is_ clever.
In Gensokyo duels should abide by the [Spell Card Rules](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Perfect_Memento_in_Strict_Sense/Draft_of_Spell_Card_Rules), but nothing prevents a simple human to just _pretend_ to create spell cards if nobody gets hurt.
She must win the battles to save Gensokyo, but if she's not really a witch she has to fake magic (by creating "spell cards" that are "illusions") and convince the enemy that everything is real; in this way they can be confused until they figure out what is really happening, giving Marisa time to deal with them and eventually win.
It's fair to say that a sufficiently complex piece of technology is almost indistinguishable from magic.

With respect to Reimu, Marisa feels more "in the background" regarding incident-solving, it doesn't help that she's just a mere human in a world of monsters.
In practical terms this works for the setting of the story: Marisa _is supposed to be_ you [the player]: she's a simple human-turned-witch and not an innate witch, she just studied a lot and gave herself to magic.

Returning to our universe, I think that the song is about what it feels like to have imposter syndrome.
Defeating foes is really just a metaphor for the everyday stuff: exams to do, deadlines to respect, conflicts with other people to resolve, etc...

Sometimes the thought that I'm not good enough creeps up; as a matter of fact this very text was hard enough to come up.
It's not unusual for me to think "What if I've been faking everything?"; while deep inside I know that it's an useless worry my brain won't let it go easily.

But still, in the end I _typically_ (not always!) succeed on my task because I know I can do it, if I put enough effort in.
Don't let your brain play tricks on you: you're clever enough to press on and solve your problems, try to believe in yourself and _work your magic_.
You may not think that your magic is real, but everyone else has to believe it: this idea of "creating illusions" is the real deal.
And when everything goes accordingly, then that's when you strike and show the world what you're capable of.

Anyway, that's just one way of seeing it.
Yet another interpretation, trivial even, is that the song is obscure enough for obscurity sake;
as if the text is pretending to say something that is not there --- hocus pocus you might say.
Maybe it's a mix of all three?

<!-- ### Bonus: Illustration -->

### Marks of Sin

We leave Marisa behind and finally go to the third track, sung by miko.
In Marks of Sin the protagonist is [Clownpiece](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Clownpiece), a peculiar fairy from hell.
Before going over the song I have to take a small detour and talk a little about the character design of Clownpiece because it's central to the song.

Clownpiece first appears in the 15th installment of the mainline serie of games: [Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom).
The plot of LoLK boils down to a divine spirit named [Junko](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Junko) that wants to invade the Lunar Capital on the Moon to vindicate her dead son. To do that she befriends a Goddess of Hell, [Hecatia](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Hecatia), which in turn presents to her her subordinate: Clownpiece. Junko "purifies" Clownpiece to make her stronger; after this ordeal she gains the power to make people insane.

The hell fairy is represented as petite and childish ~~clown~~ wearing what's basically the United States flag, while she goes to the Moon to wreck havoc --- the irony of which should not escape you.

With this introduction we can finally go over the song. The translation is taken from [Izydore/Nazohato](https://atransientfaith.wordpress.com/2018/06/05/marks-of-sin-yonder-voice/).

The song, in a sense, is about the "creation" of Clownpiece: how she became who she's now.
To be more specific the song is a metaphor that uses Clownpiece as a character.

| Original | Romaji | English |
|---|---|---|
|さてこれに無色の妖精 |sate kore ni Kuraunpiisu |Now, here’s the ~~achromatic~~ fairy Clownpiece!|
|地獄の申し子の一匹は |jigoku no moushigo no hitori wa |A single Heaven-sent child of Hell!|
|その小さな足を踏んで |sono chiisana ashi wo funde |Her little feet tread on, as she mutters|
|ぽつりぽつりと呟く |potsuri potsuri to tsubuyaku |Silently, silently, so no one would hear|

We start with what feels like the beginning of a theatrical play.
The narrator introduces Clownpiece as a fairy, without saying the word "achromatic" which is written in the text.
"無色の妖精" is spelled "moshoku to yousei" which translates to "achromatic fairy".

Notice the juxtaposition of Clownpiece's birthplace (Hell) with her being "Heaven-sent"; this will be relevant later on.


| Original | Romaji | English |
|---|---|---|
|そう、かねてより思うに |sou, kanete yori omou ni |Right, you’ve been thinking for a while|
|物足りないものがある |mono tarinai mono ga aru |She lacks so many things, after all|
|地獄の妖精にして |jigoku no yousei ni shite |As a fairy of Hell|
|その記号は何処に？ |sono shigunechaa wa doko ni? |Where is her signature ~~symbol~~?|

At this time we are witnessing a "quasi-pure" (as in "unrefined") version of Clownpiece before the events of LoLK which lacks what will be referred as "sins", hence the "achromatic" title.
In fact she lacks so many sins that she's not "recognizable" with respect to the other hell fairies: the narrator says that she lacks a signature (while the text refers to it as a symbol), probably referring to the not-yet-created spell cards like "Hell Sign [...]".

Here we encounter the first sign that Clownpiece may be a stand-in for something else by virtue of calling her a "symbol" in the text.

Before continuing I have to spend some words about what I mean for "purity" here.
"Clownpiece eventually gets purified by Junko just before the events of LoLK" means that before Junko's purification she was "normal" (for that being a sinner in hell constitutes being "normal) _and then_ she became a being of pure "impure" lifeforce capable of invading the Moon.
This doesn't mean that Clownpiece is "pure", in fact she's able to spread impurity (as in the Shinto sense of impurity, feared by Lunarians) at an alarming rate, which was the point for Junko to do it.
A better word for this kind of purity (to distinguish it from the Shinto one) is that she's in a sense more _"refined"_.
I have to stress that this song takes place before, during and after the impurity of Clownpiece is refined by Junko.

| Original | Romaji | English |
|---|---|---|
|ありとあらゆる罪人が |ari to arayuru sainin ga |All the sinners|
|この身産まれた故郷に落ちて |kono mi umareta basho ni ochite |End up falling to this place I’ve been born in|
|そして己が罪のその故にまた去ってゆく |soshite onore ga tsumi no sono yue ni mata satte yuku |But because of their own sins they’re send off back right away|
| |
|しかるにこの身には一欠けらの罪さえなく |shikaru ni kono mi ni wa hito kakera no tsumi sae naku |However, my body bears not even a single piece of sins!|
|それが故にこの身は行くべきところも無い |sore ga yue ni kono mi wa yukubeki tokoro mo nai |And because of this, there’s no place for me as well|
| |
|ただそこにあるだけではいけなかったのか、と。 |tada soko ni aru dake de wa ikenakatta no ka, to. |“But just staying here forever is wrong, right?” I was thinking|
|或いはそれがたった一つの罪か |arui wa sore ga tatta hitotsu no tsumi ka |Perhaps that is my one and only sin?|

This is the first instance of Clownpiece speaking: she entertains the idea that evil people come up in hell due to their sins, but they are so wicked that they get sent back.
Another way of viewing it is that maybe they are _called back_ from hell.

For her there's no business in hell because she's not accumulated any sins, yet she was born there.
But she wonders that maybe she has to do something, to not remain stuck there forever.

So the sinless, lacking any purpose, goes around picking fights.
