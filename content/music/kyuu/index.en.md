title: "彁 is genius and here's why"

During the New Year's Eve of 2019, an indie Japanese music group ("circle") known as 凋叶棕 (_diao ye zong_, "withered leaf") released an album simply titled "彁" at the 97th edition of Comic Market, and it kind of explored how we think about stories and creativity.

I'm sure that most people reading that first line are puzzled as to what all of those words mean, since you may not be familiar with doujinshi culture. To put it simply, Japan has a large enough indie scene of various kind, from mangas to music and even to fan-made animes, which is organized under the umbrella term of "doujinshi" (kinda meaning "indie").
Typically such endeavors are released in "events" (like, fairs) that happen multiple times during the year.
The Comic Market (or simply Comiket) is the largest event and it takes place at the Tokyo Big Sight.
In this case we are interested in doujin music (同人音楽, _doujin ongaku_) and, to be more specific, in an album based on music from Touhou Project.

Touhou is a series of doujin games, music CDs, mangas and even light novels about the life in a sealed world living beside our own called Gensokyo ("Fantasy Land"), where witches, gods and all kinds of folklore exist: basically Gensokyo is a fork of 19th century Japan in which modern technology is not prevalent and spiritualism is at its peak. Generally speaking, the plot of the games is about some youkais ("monsters") ruining stuff in Gensokyo and the heroine (you) has to battle them to fix everything.

With this innocent premise, you may be wondering: why care about an album about some games about saving the world?
Well, it really goes in depth about our relationship with stories --- really _a lot_ in depth --- but before going over the album I have to make a really important point: to understand 彁 you need to know some cursory stuff about Touhou and Gensokyo, but to give a complete enough introduction to Touhou here will further complicate this blog post.
If you played the games and have a general understanding of the story and the characters, then you're set! If not, I suggest you read [this blog post](https://magic.witchgirls.moe/2019/06/gay-girls-whom-danmaku.html) to understand more in depth what Touhou is about and its themes.
I'll still be explaining the album and its meaning as we go over it --- but I'll assume that you know basic stuff about the serie.

So, before going over the album, I _have_ to talk about the group that made it, at least a little bit.

# Who is 凋叶棕?

凋叶棕 (_Diao ye Zong_, "withered leaf"; just DyZ from now on) is a doujin music group that makes music about Touhou using music from the games. There are three important members of this group: RD-Sounds, Merami and nayuta. RD is the person in charge of everything _but_ singing: they arrange, compose, come up with lyrics and so on, while Merami and nayuta are the singers. Some other singers appear as guests and others join for guest arranges and general help, but at their the core DyZ has just those three members.

The group is focused on analyzing the characters and stories in Touhou, create new stories about them with the goal of making the listener think about a topic. The title of each album is a single kanji (character) which _is_ the topic that the group wants to explore.
In its songs RD loves to include obscure references to other works, censor some words and play around with the booklet (the paper book that comes with the CDs), all to let the listener engage more with the story that they want to tell.

With just the bare minimum of the introductions to go by, we can finally take a look at the album.

# First impressions

The very first thing you come across is the title of the album: simply "彁". As I said before, the names of the albums from DyZ are just a single kanji that set the topic for the various songs --- well, the kanji "彁" doesn't exist, so it can't have a meaning. Nice party trick huh?

In the 20th century the Japanese Industrial Standards was in development to allow the digital representation of kanjis in computers --- unfortunately some kanjis that do not exist were erroneously added to the 1976 standard. Nowadays such kanjis are called 幽霊文字 (_yuurei moji_, "ghost kanjis"), you can read more about them [here](https://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/yuureimoji.html). So not even one second in the album and just the title has three paragraphs worth of explanation. That's fun.

After looking at the title, the very next thing you come across is the cover art:

![Cover art](https://en.touhouwiki.net/images/6/6f/RDWL-0030.jpg)

In the image there is depicted [Reimu](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Reimu_Hakurei) sleeping while holding an yin-yang orb, with a stylized version of Gensokyo in the background with the title in red superimposed on everything else.
The cover art has mostly red highlights with white-ish parts, which is a play on Reimu's color palette (the "red and white miko").
Such image carries a lot of symbolism, as we shall see later on, so keep it in mind.

After the cover art, you open the jewel case and take a look at the CD:

![The CD](images/cd.png)

At first you notice just the transparent title over the bold red Gensokyo, but looking around the sides there's some text! This is something RD does a lot: almost every album has a "CD text" which includes a standard prelude and then something about it. This in particular reads:

> This CD is symbolically made from Curtain Fire Shooting game.
> You don't have to wait until it is ready.
> Because contents have already been prepared.
>
> Question:
> Why can't we stop imagining about her?
> We may have no correct answer.
> Or it's just because she is beautiful.

The first line is always the same in every album and it lets you know that this album is based on characters from Touhou. The second line is the most interesting because it talks about someone that we can't stop imagining about. That "her" that is "so beautiful" is Reimu, as a nod to her title as "Wonderful Shrine Maiden of Paradise".

Why can't we stop imagining about her? It's not just about her title, but to figure this one out we have to come back to it after listening to the songs.

# The songs

About the songs, most of them have vocals --- while some do not --- and the ones that do have an illustration in the booklet; this is typical for RD: after listening to the songs it's almost a requirement to go and look at the artworks to figure out the meaning. Not that the lyrics don't stand by themselves, but RD tries to make some concepts more obvious in the illustrations, if possible.

There is not _really_ that much to say about the instrumental songs, but for the sake of completeness I'll still go over them, albeit briefly.

Now, let's go.

## ALL EVIL MISCHIEF

The first instrumental song of the album. It's a mash-up of the Player's Score screen from Mountain of Faith and Necrofantasia from Perfect Cherry Blossom. After about 2 minutes of anticipation and crescendos with an almost evil/wicked vibe, the song develops in full with a more melancholy feel, as if what we are witnessing is the "end" of "something" important.
It then finally dies of peacefully.

Looking ahead, and considering that one of the themes here is Necrofantasia, I feel like this is an introduction to the main topic of the album: the deconstruction of Gensokyo.

## ホーカス・ポーカス

_Hocus Pocus_ is the second song of the album, with vocals from Merami. It stars [Marisa Kirisame](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Marisa_Kirisame), an ordinary magician and long-time friend of Reimu.
If taken literally, the song is about Marisa burning alive a group of catholics as retribution for the witch-hunts of 15th to 18th century Europe; but there are other possible interpretations so we'll still go over it.

First of all "Hocus Pocus" is a (non-sense) magic formula which can mean two things: either nothing, as in "something meaningless", or a deception of sorts to hide something from another person. This will come in handy later on when those words are referenced.

The song starts with someone whispering the following:

| Original | Romaji | English |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 信じる者はすくわれる    | shinjiru mono wa sukuwareru |Believers shall be saved                          |
| 足から全部すくわれる    | ashi kara zenbu sukuwareru  |From the soles of their feet to tip of their heads|
| わかっていながらもーー  | wakatte inagara mo          |While I knew that, still-- |

The first two lines are in reference to Deuteronomy 28:35 which, regarding what happens to Israeliti people for _disobeying_ God, states:

> The Lord will give you sore boils on your knees and legs that cannot be cured, and they will go from the soles of your feet to the tops of your heads.

In the case of the lyrics the meaning is reversed! The one speaking is apparently either about to do something bad --- for which they figured that what they are doing is morally questionable --- or they are a victim.

From now on Marisa will speak until the end of the song.

| Original | Romaji | English |
|----------|--------|---------|
|お前は弱くも脆弱で| omae wa yowaku mo zeijaku de | You are weak and fragile |
|どうせ誰にも勝てはしない | douse dare ni mo kate wa shinai | There's no way you could win against anyone |
|生まれ育ちは　変えられぬままに |umaresodachi wa kaerarenu mama ni |You were born and raised like that, and you never changed |
|身の程知るがいいが |minohodo shiru ga ii ga |                      So you better not forget who you are |
|しかるにお前は賢くって|    shikaru ni omae wa kashikoku tte | On the other hand, you are rather smart|
|そればかりは誰にも負けない|sore bakari wa dare ni mo makenai |No one's gonna beat you on that plane|
|たった一つの　その武器を持てば | tatta hitotsu no sono buki wo moteba | You only need that one weapon|
|怖いものなく |                   kowai mono naku |                      And you should fear no one|
|たとえこの世界が |tatoe kono sekai ga |So even when the world|
|牙を剥き出しにしても |kiba wo mukidashi ni shite mo |Bares its fangs at you |
|そのすべて撃せばいい |sono subete taoseba ii |You should have no problem defeating them|
|「方法」はもう知ったから |yarikato wa mou shitta kara |After all, you know the right way to do it!|

Here Marisa is speaking in second-person to one or more people.
She describes someone which is both really weak and extremely smart/clever at the same time: so smart that even if the circumstances are dire they can turn around whatever challenge they are facing.
Notice how the voice of the singer changes as she talks about the traits: for being weak you can feel _pity_ mixed with _disgust_, for being clever she is more _proud_ and happy. When talking about ways to live on she becomes more wicked.

<!-- Another way of interpreting it is that, really, there are _two_ groups of people that she's describing. -->
<!-- This however doesn't make sense. -->

| Original | Romaji | English |
|----------|--------|---------|
|傾け　もっと　もっと重く |katamuke motto motto omoku |Now bend, as the weight gets bigger|
|あるもの皆　乗せ切るまで |aru mono mina nosekiru made |Until you pull through everything|
|そしたら全部　くべるんだ |soshitara zenbu kuberu nda |Afterwards, throw them all in the fire|
|ひとさじの未練ごと |hito saji no miren-goto |Add a spoonful of regret!|

Whoever she's referring to has to go on with a great _sacrifice_ to make ends meet, knowing full well that in the end it's useless and they will regret it later on.
This can be connected to the first stanza: we can safely assume that there's a ritual going on which will result in the one doing it to be "saved" in some way --- but they know something isn't right: they are hurting people and it isn't working.


| Original | Romaji | English |
|----------|--------|---------|
|ホーカス・ポーカス |hookasu pookasu |Hocus Pocus|
|この魔法に種も仕掛けもないのだと |kono mahou ni tane mo shikake mo nai no da to |There's no trick to this magic|
|信じるも信じぬも愚か |shinjiru mo shinjinu mo oroka |You're a fool whether you believe in it or not|
|さあどうだざまあみろ |saa dou da zamaa miro |Now tell me how you like it!|

Those last two stanzas kinda point out that the second-person verses may be self-referential and what we're really observing is Marisa herself, maybe carrying out a great "magic" she's unsure about.

In the first verse Marisa makes fun of herself by noting that all of this is just hocus pocus --- **an illusion** of sorts.
We then cannot conclude that what she did it was made with magic: we are fools for thinking that what she's doing is "real magic" or if that it's an illusion. What is really happening then? Well we can't know, because to know what's happening we need to look beyond the illusion but we don't know if we're being tricked anyway! So, what gives? We have to pretend that what we're reading is both true and false at the same time: magic exists, but something isn't right.

| Original | Romaji | English |
|----------|--------|---------|
|目をつぶれば微かに |me wo tsubureba kasuka ni |Close your eyes, see the calming darkness|
|耳をふさげば静かに |mimi wo fusageba shizuka ni |Plug your ears, hear the silence|
|向き合うべき解答ーー |mukiaubeki kotae |You're approaching your answer--|

Still she tries anyway, because she's sure to win in the end.

| Original | Romaji | English |
|----------|--------|---------|
|お前は脆くも貧相で |omae wa moroku mo hinsou de |You are brittle and seedy-looking|
|どうせ与するに値しない |douse kumisuru ni atai shinai |You're not worthy enough to side with anyone|
|気づけ　端から敵しかいないと |kidzuke hashi kara teki shika inai to |Notice, from the very beginning, you were surrounded by enemies|
|そうしか生きられない |sou shika ikirarenai |And you always will be|
|しかるにお前は賢しくて |shikaru ni omae wa sakashikute |On the other hand, you are rather intelligent|
|そればかりがおまえの味方 |sore bakari ga omae no mikata |And that brain of yours is your one ally|
|たった一つの　その武器の限り |tatta hitotsu no sono buki no kagiri |As long as you hold that only weapon|
|孤高に立てよ |kokou ni tateyo |You can stand proud|
|たとえなにもかもが |tatoe nani mo ka mo ga |Even if someone says|
|不可能だといってさえ |fukanou da to itte sae |That it's all impossible|
|そのすべて否定しよう |sono subete hitei shiyou |Refute all of that|
|「方法」はもう知ったから |yarikata wa mō shitta kara |After all, you know the right way to do it!|

Again she goes on about describing herself: right now she's alone but her intellect and her insane resolve are strong enough to try the impossible.

| Original | Romaji | English | English Alt |
|----------|--------|---------|-------------|
|俯け　もっと　もっと深く |utsumuke motto motto fukaku |Now bow down deeper, even deeper|
|その背に負う　十字の分だけ |sono se ni ou juuji no bun dake |Carry your part of the crucifix|
|そうして全部　燃やすんだ |soushite zenbu moyasu nda |Afterwards, let everything burn|
|ひとすじの火種として |hitosuji no koi to shite |Like a single ~~live coal~~ romance|  With the spark of love to light the flame|
|ホーカス・ポーカス |hookasu pookasu |Hocus Pocus|
|どれほども犠牲にしてなお足りないが |dore hodo mo gisei ni shite nao tarinai ga |No matter how much you sacrifice, it'll never be enough|
|もとより釣り合いはしない |motoyori tsuriai wa shinai |It will never be balanced out|
|だから“魔法”なんだろう？ |dakara mahou na ndarou |That's why it's called "magic", right?|

Marisa is trying to convince her enemies ~~(and herself)~~ that this magic is all real; after all, it's "normal" that it doesn't initially work: it can't be balanced out.
Obviously, this is a made up excuse.

Also, one of the words written in the booklet is not sung! In "ひとすじの**火種**として", 火種 is "hidame", which means "live coal". Instead "koi" is sung, which means love or romance.


| Original | Romaji | English |
|----------|--------|---------|
|一歩　一歩　また一歩| ippo ippo mata ippo |Step after step, and then one more|
|証拠が積み上がりゆく| shouko ga tsumiagariyuku |Evidence just keeps accumulating|
|この智はこうと告げている |kono chi wa kou to tsugete iru |I will tell my wisdom in such a way|
|けしてたどり着けぬとーー |keshite tadoritsukenu to| That you would never understand|
|だから| dakara| So,|
|閃け　もっと　もっと高く| hirameke motto motto takaku| Gleam, higher and higher!|
|人には届かぬ世界へ| hito ni wa todokanu sekai he| In a world no human can reach|
|そうして全部　虚仮にしろ| soushite zenbu koke ni shiro| And then make a fool of everyone|
|ひとひらの法則さえ| hitohira no ruuru sae| Even this single rule!|

People are figuring out her tricks, but she doesn't care: she will bluff and continue to do so until everyone is convinced that they're witnessing real magic.
Through the sheer power of lies she will finally transcend what is possible for a mere human and beat everyone, while maintaining this illusion.


| Original | Romaji | English |
|----------|--------|---------|
|ホーカス・ポーカス |hookasu pookasu |Hocus Pocus|
|この魔法は種も仕掛けもないがゆえ |kono mahou wa tane mo shikake mo nai ga yue |There's no trick to this magic, that's why|
|解答を全部ねじ伏せろ |kotae wo zenbu nejifusero |I will force all the answers on you|
|信じればかなうから |shinjireba kanau kara |Once you believe it, it'll come true|
|ホーカス・ポーカス |hookasu pookasu |Hocus Pocus|
|この魔法が　全部幻なんてもう |kono mahou ga zenbu maboroshi nante mou |This magic is nothing but an illusion|
|とっくのとうに　知っているさ |tokku no tou ni shitte iru sa |I actually knew it all along|
|私は賢いからな |watashi wa kashikoi kara na |Because I'm real smart, you know!|

And finally revealing her tricks.

You can observe that the lyrics for this song are total hocus pocus: either they are meaningless or they _pretend to be meaningless_.
What does it all mean anyway?

<!-- ### A meta-analysis -->

Thinking about the song as simply "Marisa burning some catholics alive" is kinda reductive, isn't it? Alas we can't really tell what is happening or the exact reason for such sacrifices.
Really, a more interesting interpretation is that what we are witnessing is just Marisa trying to solve an incident and dueling the various bosses and fairies _without_ using magic. In fact, she may be making everything up, bullshitting her way until the incident is solved.

Compared to other characters Marisa is kinda weak: to give some perspective the heroine Reimu can just ["float out of existence"](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Reimu_Hakurei#Abilities) to win a battle. But still, Marisa's the other main heroine, she must win the battles! But how? RD poses that what she lacks in mere strength is compensated with brain power: well, she _is_ clever.
In Gensokyo duels should abide by the [Spell Card Rules](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Perfect_Memento_in_Strict_Sense/Draft_of_Spell_Card_Rules), but nothing prevents a simple human to just _pretend_ to create spell cards if nobody gets hurt.
She must win the battles to save Gensokyo, but if she's not really a witch she has to fake magic (by creating "spell cards" that are "illusions") and convince the enemy that everything is real; in this way they can be confused until they figure out what is really happening, giving Marisa time to deal with them and eventually win.
It's fair to say that a sufficiently complex piece of technology is almost indistinguishable from magic.
