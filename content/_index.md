Welcome to Suzunaan, a WIP incubator for indie projects that span between software,
music analysis, translations, social commentaries and more to come.
We subscribe to the [Yesterweb manifesto](https://yesterweb.org), in fact our
goals are to build a small community of folks interested in the
[Indie Web](https://indieweb.org/) and to spread its usage as an alternative to
the tech giant's web.

Contributors are welcome, but please first read the [guidelines](/contributing).
