This website and its projects are 100% machine free:
we use the best organic and biological human brains we can source.
Which means that we _don't_ use:

  - Chat-GPT (or others) to write the content in this blog.
  - Copilot (or others) to write code.
  - Stable Diffusion (or others) to make logos, doodles, etc...

Because we have _fun_ doing what we do.
Writing, coding and drawing do not feel like chores because we like doing that.


In its current state (2024), AI is practical for major players like
OpenAI, Google and the like, not the common citizens.
The leaked LLAMA doesn't count: no hobbyist was gonna train something like it in the first place.
The fact that they can scrape the web for data, to build their _private_ datasets
and models, should pose some ethical questions.

The next time you are waiting for Copilot's auto-completion, please,
think about it a bit.
